# Astro + Svelte + Bootstrap + PurgeCSS Example

for development with HMR run `npm run dev`
to build the project as a static html export run `npm run build`
to preview the build (still needs a server) run `npm run preview`

Aiming to get a basic working project together using these four frameworks.

there's some quirks with purgecss at the moment where the dev task won't include svelte component styles, but they come through fine on build

[Based on this svelte astro starter](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/framework-svelte)
